# refactor-accessibility

## A refactoring of the Horiseon website to include the necessary accessibility features to ensure consideration for all end users alike.

In order to ensure a accessible application is available to all consumers, refactoring was required to add accessibility and ensure assistive technologies are properly in place. While following the Scout Rule, the code was left a little cleaner than it was found. Changes include, but are not limited to, addressing HTML semantics, applying CSS consolidations, and adding HTML and CSS comments for ease of future use.  

## Mock Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality after refactoring:
